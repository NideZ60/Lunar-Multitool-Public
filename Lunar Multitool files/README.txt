Lunar-Multitool-Public

Note: Wireshark mode only works IF you have wireshark installed aswell as ncap (most of the time will ask you to install with wireshark)

just keep this folder on your desktop (Lunar multitool files) and drag the 'Lunar' file to the desktop. All logs will be stored in the folder if you want to check them, each time you  use this program again it overwrites the logs so if you want them saved just keep drag it out.
